# r.wind.sun
r.wind.sun implements a method to calculate visibility of aerogenerators and photovoltaic panels using an impact index. 

More information regarding method conceived here: https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/8108007/An_Open_Source_GIS_Tool.pdf . 

This code is optimized for GRASS GIS 64, and it is also included in official addons: https://svn.osgeo.org/grass/grass-addons/grass6/raster/r.wind.sun/r.wind.sun.py .

# r.wind.sun_aqua
r.wind.sun_aqua updates r.wind.sun code to be used in GRASS GIS 8 for the part limited to photovoltaic panels. The code is in very-alpha version, it has no user interface updated, but it has been recently used to evaluate visibility of existing and potential aquaculture facilites offshore Gaeta coast (Italy).
